# SimpleTransitions

This is a walk through of a simple transition where an orange and blue text box exchange places through a diagonal transition.

Directions:
Open up the app. Look at the xml layouts. This shows the four text views. 
Open up the StartActivity and EndActivity java files. Both Activites have a 
lot of code that is commented out and directions for running through Cases 1 through 5.
In each case I uncomment some lines, and in some cases I uncomment some lines and also add some text.

Case 1 is already set up. Run it. Then make Case 2 changes and run those and so on.
